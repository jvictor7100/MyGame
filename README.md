# MyGame
This is a terminal game developed by me (jvictor7100). In simplified terms, the program chooses a random number and you must discover it. While the player guesses, hints are provided. It's simple, but i think it very enjoyable.

Note: If you are trying to run the main.py file and are getting a ModuleNotFoundError, copy the python files and place them in the same folder.
